## Getting Started

```
$ npm install
$ npm install -g nodemon
$ npm install --save-dev nodemon
$ npm run build
$ nvm use 12.18.0 # don't know why the version of node is not sticking
$ nodemon
$ # make changes and then run
$ nvm run build
```

You need to be using a very new version of node in order to get the experimental
modular javascript (.mjs) functionality.
